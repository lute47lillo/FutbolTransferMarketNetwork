    Notes:
        High performing teams share community (based on modularity).
        Average teams are not concentrated in one community, but spread.
        Low performing are also spread but do not share communities with high-performing teams

        Community 3 ->  1/21     5%
        Community 4 ->  6/21    29%

    Notes:
        Teams with medium to high tend to transfer more between themselves 7/13 are in community 3 54%
            - Groups 1 and 2.

        Teams with medium to low are spread out between 2 predominant communities 20/31 -> 65 (1 and 2). 
        With barely contact with community 3.

    Meaning, there is an abstraction between High-performing (More money spent) and Low-performing (Less money spent)
    Contrary to the popular belief, that you will not try to transfer between teams that are direct competitors of yourself

They have all attributes in common:

    Performance:
        Individual positions:
            HIGH BC:
                Bolton Wanderers: 13
                Crystal Palace: 14
                Liverpool FC: 5

                Leicester City: 11
                Southampton FC: 12

            They average a 12-15 position (~13)

            LOW BC:
                Blackpool FC: 19
                Bradford City: 20
                Ipswich Town: 12

                Huddersfield Town: 18
                Cardiff City: 19

        
        They average a 12-20 position (Relegation levels)

    The better connected, the better you will do. Not necessarily to a High performing level.
    But, no connection implies worse results.

    Money Spent: 
        HIGH BC:
            Bolton Wanderers: 506

            Leicester City: 554
            Southampton FC: 704

        LOW BC:

            Bradford City: 6.6
            Ipswich Town: 41.98

            Huddersfield Town: 138.30
            Cardiff City: 123.875

MENTION ON CONClUSIONS
    Decision Support: If were to be a player. Do not go to High BC teams, they change a lot. Go to lower BC,
    but avoid teams that have historically performed under 18.

    Also, need to understand that positions are calculated based in an average years of play on premier league.

    Also, High BC tend to spend more than average -> 795.545 millions of euros in average spent by those teams.
