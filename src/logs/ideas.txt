In the year 1998, Watts and Strogatz et al published a
paper in Nature based on the clustering coefficient
measure [17]. The cluster is a measure of the likelihood
that two associates of a node are associating themselves.
A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater
’cliquishness’. In most real-world networks, if node A is


connected to node B and node B is connected to node C,
then node A is also connected to node C as well. In a
socialnetwork, the friendship between individuals shows
that there is a higher probability that a friend of your
friend is also your friend. The clustering coefficient value
lies in the range 0 ≤ C ≤ 1. 


IDEA: Study what is the clustering coeff between big leagues. Like what are the pair association bigger (Serie A- LaLiga for example (?))
