In the year 1998, Watts and Strogatz et al published a
paper in Nature based on the clustering coefficient
measure [17]. The cluster is a measure of the likelihood
that two associates of a node are associating themselves.
A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater
’cliquishness’. In most real-world networks, if node A is


connected to node B and node B is connected to node C,
then node A is also connected to node C as well. In a
socialnetwork, the friendship between individuals shows
that there is a higher probability that a friend of your
friend is also your friend. The clustering coefficient value
lies in the range 0 ≤ C ≤ 1. 

1 is clique (fully connected)

IDEA: Study what is the clustering coeff between big leagues. 

1. If get clustering coeff of all nodes of big all graph. 
    Node with higher clustering coefficient means has more connections with the rest. By triangles A->B. B->C. Then A->C also.

2. If only calculate average clustering coefficient of temas within their own community.
    Communuties could be leagues, then -> what league is more connected. Compare to Omega quantity.
        - 1 League + the rest. Iterate and compare, what pair is more connected. They have more transfers.

    Communities could be the ones generated by all dataset. Then what of those is more connected? I will have to create a Graph
    only with those nodes.


Like what are the pair association bigger (Serie A - LaLiga for example (?))
