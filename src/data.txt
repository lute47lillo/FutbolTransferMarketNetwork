SOME EARLY CONCLUSIONS: HIGH p-values indicate that your evidence is NOT STRONG ENOUGH to suggest an effect exists in the population.

However, there is a strong correlation that might show that teams that receive more money, tend to usually win more,
rather than logical idea given by 'spending more means winning more'
